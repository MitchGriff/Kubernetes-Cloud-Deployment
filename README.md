###### Install and deploy a multi-node container-based computing service on Kubernetes.
###### Project Primary Task:
###### Propose a computing service consisting of at least three service component (i.e., a web server with a backend SQL server and a Single-Sign-On LDAP server for authentication  purposes) and deploy the corresponding containers inside Kubernetes infrastructure.
###### Project Subtasks:
###### Able to setup containers (possibly on local computers) that work together to provide a unified computing service to users.
###### Able to utilize Docker compose and Dockerfile to automate the deployment of the containers on a Kubernetes cluster and expose the service to the public.
###### All containers must be on its own subnet and not using the container engineâ€™s default network.
## Installation and Deployment
### Deliverable 1:
### Team description
Create an apache web server connected to a SQL database of users.  Create a login server which can add, delete and authenticate users on an LDAP server.  
###### Documentation describing the selected computing service, including network diagram and specific details on what services being installed on which container.
### Deliverable 2:
###### In-class demonstration of the selected computing services on local machines or on CloudLab (may or may not be automated on CloudLab).
###### A 10-minute recorded presentation/demonstration (YouTube)
###### 24-hour Q&A session via Discord team channel
###### Weekly progress report (Friday).
### Deliverable 3:
###### Written Project report and/(or) GitHub repository contains all necessary compose file and Dockerfile to deploy the service on CloudLab.
